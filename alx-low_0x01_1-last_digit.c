/* 
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

* You can find the source code here
* The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
* You donâ€™t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
* The output of the program should be:
** The string Last digit of, followed by n, followed by
** the string is, followed by
*** if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
*** if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
*** if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
** followed by a new line
